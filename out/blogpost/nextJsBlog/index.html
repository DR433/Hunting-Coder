Google has contributed to the Next.js project, contributing 43 pull requests in 2019, where they helped in pruning unused JavaScript, reducing loading time, and adding improved metrics.[12] As of March 2022, the framework is used by many large websites, including Walmart, Apple, Nike, Netflix, TikTok, Uber, Lyft, and Starbucks.[8] In early 2020, it was announced that Vercel had secured twenty-one million dollars in Series A funding to support improvements to the software.[1] The framework's original author, Guillermo Rauch, is currently the CEO of Vercel, and the project's lead maintainer is Tim Neutkens.[13]</div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"parsedData":{"title":"How To Learn NextJs in 2023","author":"Cindy Jackson","date":"04-02-2023 4th February, 2023","content":"Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites.[7] React is a JavaScript library that is traditionally used to build web applications rendered in the client's browser with JavaScript.[8] Developers recognize several problems with this strategy however, such as not catering to users who do not have access to JavaScript or have disabled it, potential security issues, significantly extended page loading times, and harm to the site's overall search engine optimization.[8] Frameworks such as Next.js sidestep these problems by allowing some or all of the website to be rendered on the server-side before being sent to the client.[8][9] Next.js is one of the most popular frameworks for React.[10] It is one of several recommended 'toolchains' available when starting a new app, all of which provide a layer of abstraction to aid in common tasks.[11] Next.js requires Node.js and can be initialized using Node Package Manager.
